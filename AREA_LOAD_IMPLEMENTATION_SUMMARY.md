## Key Implementation Details

### Load Distribution Methods

The implementation supports three main load distribution methods:

1. **One-Way Distribution**: Load is distributed to two parallel edges
2. **Two-Way Distribution**: Load is distributed based on relative span lengths
3. **Open Structure Distribution**: Load is distributed based on projected area

### Effective Pressure Calculation

The effective pressure is calculated using the dot product between the load direction vector and the face normal:

```
effective_pressure = pressure_magnitude * |dot(load_direction, face_normal)|
```

This ensures that the pressure is correctly projected onto the surface, taking into account the angle between the load direction and the surface normal.

### Coordinate System Mapping

The implementation handles coordinate system mapping between FreeCAD and the solver:
- FreeCAD X → Solver X
- FreeCAD Y → Solver Z
- FreeCAD Z → Solver Y

### Edge Distribution Factors

The implementation calculates edge distribution factors based on the selected distribution method:
1. **One-Way**: Load goes to two parallel edges (0.5 each)
2. **Two-Way**: Load is distributed based on relative edge lengths
3. **Open Structure**: Load is distributed based on projection factors
