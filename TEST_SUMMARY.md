- NumPoints properties existence and defaults
- Backward compatibility functions
- Execute method testing
- Load handling and reaction results
- Structured results and export methods
- Integration tests with multiple elements

### 2. test_diagram_comprehensive.py
**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing of diagram.py functionality
**Size**: ~300 lines
**Coverage**:
- Object creation and property verification
- Diagram display properties
- Unit conversion and Thai units support
- Coordinate mapping and member processing
- Text generation and face creation
- Integration with calc objects
- View provider testing

### 3. test_structuretools_full.py
**Purpose**: Full integration testing of calc.py and diagram.py working together
**Size**: ~250 lines
**Coverage**:
- Calc-diagram integration
- Backward compatibility features
- Unit conversion synchronization

**Coverage**:
- Direct testing of the original AttributeError issue
- NumPoints properties existence and defaults
- Backward compatibility function verification
- Execute method testing (main fix verification)
- getattr usage with defaults
- Backward compatibility simulation

### 5. run_all_tests.py
**Purpose**: Test runner that executes all test suites
**Size**: ~50 lines
**Features**:
- Sequential execution of all test suites
- Success/failure tracking
- Error handling and reporting

### 6. COMPREHENSIVE_TESTS_README.md
**Purpose**: Detailed instructions for running tests
**Size**: ~150 lines
**Content**:
- How to run tests in FreeCAD Python console
- How to run tests from command line
- Test coverage details
- Troubleshooting guide
- Test development guidelines

## Key Test Scenarios

### NumPoints Properties Verification
- All 5 NumPoints properties exist: NumPointsMoment, NumPointsAxial, NumPointsShear, NumPointsTorque, NumPointsDeflection
- Correct default values: 5, 3, 4, 3, 4 respectively
- Properties accessible without AttributeError

### Backward Compatibility Testing
- ensure_required_properties method functionality
- _addPropIfMissing helper function
- Property restoration for older calc objects
- onDocumentRestored method

### Integration Testing
- Calc and diagram modules working together
- Unit conversion between modules
- Reaction results flow
- Load combination handling

### Error Handling
- AttributeError prevention for NumPoints properties
- Graceful handling of missing properties
- Exception handling in critical methods

## Test Execution Methods

1. **Individual Test Files**: Each test file can be run independently
2. **Batch Execution**: run_all_tests.py executes all tests sequentially
3. **FreeCAD Python Console**: Tests can be run directly in FreeCAD
4. **Command Line**: Tests can be executed from command line

## Verification Results

All tests are designed to:
- ✅ Pass when the NumPoints fix is correctly implemented
- ❌ Fail when the original AttributeError would occur
- ⚠️ Handle edge cases and error conditions gracefully
