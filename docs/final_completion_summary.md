- ✅ Implemented story forces distribution methods (ASCE 7-22, linear, uniform, custom)
- ✅ Added vertical component options for seismic analysis
- ✅ Created interactive updating between inputs for real-time calculation
- ✅ Added visualization options for story forces distribution

### Phase 3: Advanced Features Implementation
- ✅ Implemented load pattern visualization with 3D visualization capabilities
- ✅ Added more building type presets and code-specific calculations
- ✅ Implemented additional Thai standard specifics with provincial seismic considerations
- ✅ Added multiple spectrum comparison views with real spectrum data support
- ✅ Implemented 3D visualization of load application

### Phase 4: Integration and Quality Assurance
- ✅ Integrated the story_forces.py module with the GUI
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and validation
- ✅ Created unit tests for the new functionality
- ✅ Documented the new features and usage
